# Unigen
A simple tool to generate .unistore files

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

- [Igdb api v4](https://github.com/twitchtv/igdb-api-python) and [python dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv). Those libraries can be installed with:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Client id and an API token for igdb, you can obtain those by visiting this link : https://api-docs.igdb.com/#account-creation

- You need to create a .env file with those informations in the same way the file example.env has been created

- (Optional) A domain name (or subdomain) and some knowledge about reverse proxies or port forwarding

## Usage

- Run unigen.py
- Fill in the information asked (you can choose to create information about the store, though this is not necessary since you can add them later)
- Wait for the process to finish (this can take a long time depending on the speed of your disk and the amount of games added)
- Once done, head to the directory named 'server', you will find 3 files generated by the program : ```.unistore```, ```unigen.t3sx``` and ```unigen.html```. You can now place your games in the 'games' folder and make them easily accessible.

## Credits

External tools are used for the creation of the t3x file :
- [Tex3ds](https://github.com/devkitPro/tex3ds)
- [3ds-TitleID-Generator](https://github.com/bryan-pakulski/3ds-TitleID-Extractor)
